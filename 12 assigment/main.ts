// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

//Answer: 12


let  friendsName = [ "Ahmed Raza", "Muhammad Rehan", "Rimsha","Ramaza"];

friendsName.forEach(friendName => console.log(`Hello ${friendName}, How are you`));
