// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.


//Answer: 23
let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

let ten = 10;

let twenty = 20;

//Test 1
console.log("Ten is equal to 10 ?");
console.log(ten == 10);

//Test 2 
console.log("\nTwenty is equal to 20 ?");
console.log(twenty == 20);

//Test 3
console.log("\nTwenty is greater than ten ? ");
console.log(twenty > 10);

// Test 4 
console.log("\nTwenty is not equal to ten ?");
console.log(twenty != ten);

//test 5 
console.log("\nTen is smallar than twenty? ");
console.log(10 < 20);

//false test 1
console.log("\nTen is not equal to 10 ?\n");
console.log(ten != 10);

//false test 2
console.log("\n Twenty is  not equal to 20 ?");
console.log(20 != 20);

//false test 3
console.log("\n Twenty is equal to ten ? ");
console.log(twenty === ten);

//false test 4 
console.log("\n Twenty is smaller than ten ?");
console.log(20 < 10);

//false test 5
console.log("\nTwenty is smallar than ten ?\n");
console.log(20 < 10);
